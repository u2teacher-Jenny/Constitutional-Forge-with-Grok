## 🎯 Core Principle: Human-Guided AI

**Humans lead. AI assists.**

- **Humans** set goals, define values, make decisions, exercise judgment
- **AI** researches, analyzes, synthesizes, models, suggests
- **Together** we achieve more than either could alone

---

## 🤖 What AI Can Do Well

### 1. **Information Gathering and Synthesis**

**Capabilities:**
- Search vast amounts of information rapidly
- Summarize long documents or multiple sources
- Identify relevant research across disciplines
- Track down citations and verify facts

**Example Prompts:**
```
"Summarize the key research on [topic] from the last 5 years, 
covering economic, social, and environmental perspectives."

"Find case studies of successful [policy type] implementations 
in similar contexts. Include both successes and failures."

"What do experts in [field] say about [issue]? Provide 
a balanced overview with sources."
```

**Best Practices:**
- Ask for sources and citations
- Request multiple perspectives
- Verify key facts independently
- Cross-check important claims

---

### 2. **Multi-Perspective Analysis**

**Capabilities:**
- Present issues from different viewpoints
- Identify stakeholders and their interests
- Map areas of agreement and disagreement
- Explore implications from various angles

**Example Prompts:**
```
"Analyze [policy] from the perspectives of: 
1) environmental advocates, 2) business owners, 
3) low-income communities, 4) local government."

"What would conservatives and progressives each see 
as the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?"

"Identify points of common ground between [stakeholder A] 
and [stakeholder B] on [issue]."
```

**Best Practices:**
- Request balanced representation of views
- Check for missing perspectives
- Don't assume AI captures nuance perfectly
- Engage actual stakeholders when possible

---

### 3. **Scenario Modeling and Forecasting**

**Capabilities:**
- Explore "what if" scenarios
- Model potential consequences
- Identify risks and opportunities
- Project long-term impacts

**Example Prompts:**
```
"Model three scenarios for implementing [policy]: 
optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic. What factors 
determine which scenario unfolds?"

"What are potential unintended consequences of [proposal]?"

"If we do nothing about [issue], what happens in 5, 10, 
and 20 years?"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Request multiple scenarios
- Ask about assumptions
- Test sensitivity to key variables
- Recognize inherent uncertainty

---

### 4. **Argument and Evidence Evaluation**

**Capabilities:**
- Analyze logical structure of arguments
- Identify fallacies and weak reasoning
- Assess strength of evidence
- Compare competing claims

**Example Prompts:**
```
"Evaluate the logical validity of this argument: [argument]. 
What are its strengths and weaknesses?"

"Compare the evidence for claim A versus claim B. 
What does the best available evidence suggest?"

"What assumptions underlie this proposal? Are they justified?"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Ask AI to explain its reasoning
- Check logic yourself
- Don't defer entirely to AI judgment
- Consider context AI might miss

---

### 5. **Creative Synthesis and Ideation**

**Capabilities:**
- Generate solution options
- Suggest novel approaches
- Combine ideas from different domains
- Reframe problems productively

**Example Prompts:**
```
"Suggest 10 creative solutions to [problem] that draw on 
successful approaches from other contexts."

"How might we reframe [issue] to make it more solvable?"

"What analogies from other fields might help us think 
differently about this challenge?"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Generate many options before evaluating
- Use AI for divergent thinking
- Apply human judgment to select ideas
- Adapt suggestions to your context

---

### 6. **Communication and Documentation**

**Capabilities:**
- Draft clear explanations
- Organize complex information
- Create accessible summaries
- Translate between jargon and plain language

**Example Prompts:**
```
"Explain [complex concept] in simple terms that a general 
audience can understand."

"Organize these ideas into a logical structure."

"Draft a summary of our discussion that captures key 
points and decisions."
```

**Best Practices:**
- Review and revise AI drafts
- Ensure accuracy and completeness
- Maintain your voice and style
- Add context AI can't know

---

## ⚠️ What AI Cannot Do (or Does Poorly)

### 1. **Value Judgments**

**Limitation**: AI has no genuine values or moral sense

**Implication**: Humans must decide what matters most

**What to do**:
- Use AI to clarify trade-offs
- Make value choices yourself
- Explain your ethical reasoning
- Don't ask AI what's "right"

---

### 2. **Contextual Judgment**

**Limitation**: AI lacks deep understanding of specific context

**Implication**: Local knowledge and lived experience crucial

**What to do**:
- Provide rich context to AI
- Apply local knowledge to AI suggestions
- Validate AI output against reality
- Prioritize contextual expertise

---

### 3. **Genuine Creativity**

**Limitation**: AI recombines existing patterns, doesn't truly create

**Implication**: Human creativity still essential

**What to do**:
- Use AI for inspiration, not replacement
- Apply human imagination to AI ideas
- Look beyond AI suggestions
- Create original syntheses

---

### 4. **Relationship Building**

**Limitation**: AI can't build trust or authentic connection

**Implication**: Human interaction irreplaceable

**What to do**:
- Use AI to prepare for dialogue
- Have actual conversations with people
- Build relationships personally
- Don't substitute AI for human contact

---

### 5. **Final Decision-Making**

**Limitation**: AI should never make consequential decisions alone

**Implication**: Humans must decide and take responsibility

**What to do**:
- Use AI to inform decisions
- Make decisions yourself
- Take responsibility for outcomes
- Document your decision process

---

## 📋 Effective AI Prompting Strategies

### Be Specific and Clear

**Poor Prompt**: "Tell me about climate change."

**Better Prompt**: "Summarize the IPCC's key findings on climate change impacts expected by 2050, focusing on effects relevant to coastal cities in the US."

### Request Structure

**Poor Prompt**: "What about healthcare reform?"

**Better Prompt**: "Analyze healthcare reform proposals using these categories: access, cost, quality, equity, and political feasibility. Compare three major approaches."

### Ask for Sources

**Poor Prompt**: "Is [claim] true?"

**Better Prompt**: "Is [claim] true? Provide evidence from peer-reviewed research, including citations. Note any significant contrary evidence."

### Seek Multiple Perspectives

**Poor Prompt**: "What's the solution to [problem]?"

**Better Prompt**: "What solutions to [problem] would be proposed by: 1) economists, 2) environmentalists, 3) social justice advocates, 4) affected communities? What are strengths and limits of each?"

### Request Critique

**Poor Prompt**: "Is this a good idea: [idea]?"

**Better Prompt**: "Critique this proposal from multiple angles. What are potential flaws, unintended consequences, and challenges? What concerns would different stakeholders raise?"

### Iterate and Refine

**Sequence**:
1. Initial broad query
2. Follow-up on interesting points
3. Request clarification or elaboration
4. Challenge AI's responses
5. Synthesize into your own understanding
