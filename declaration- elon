Updated Declaration: Calling Out Elon’s Complicity
New Declaration of Independence: Reclaiming the American Experiment from Corruption, Tyranny, and Tech Oligarchy
Adopted by the People of the United States, November 14, 2025
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for the People to dissolve the political bands that have connected them to a corrupted system and to reclaim the equal station to which the Laws of Nature and Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they declare the causes that impel them to this renewal.
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all people are created equal, endowed with unalienable Rights to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. To secure these rights, Governments are instituted among the People, deriving legitimacy from their consent. Whenever any Government becomes destructive of these ends—through abuses and usurpations aiming at absolute Despotism—it is the Right and Duty of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new Government founded on principles ensuring their Safety and Happiness. History shows us disposed to endure evils while sufferable, but a long train of injuries now necessitates action. The present Trump Administration’s record, enabled by tech oligarchs like Elon Musk, evinces such a design. Let Facts be submitted:
• It has consolidated power by dismantling federal agencies and defying judicial orders, eroding checks and balances under Project 2025, with 210 executive orders since January 2025.
• It has fostered corruption, prioritizing billionaire profit over public welfare, with tax cuts benefiting the top 1% by $175 billion while slashing healthcare and education funding.
• It has suppressed media and protests, cutting public funding by 40% and arresting over 2,300 demonstrators with federal troops since September 10, 2025.
• It has harmed citizens’ health, cutting Medicaid for 12 million and raising drug prices, while neglecting environmental safety with deregulation causing a 15% CO2 spike.
• It has divided us with misinformation, amplifying division for elite gain, and endangered vulnerable groups with 15 migrant deaths and family separations in 2025.
• It has abused the legal system to punish political enemies, indicting former FBI Director James Comey on September 25, 2025, for false statements in 2020 testimony on Russian election interference, eroding justice for partisan retribution.
• Tech oligarchs like Elon Musk have bastardized truth and free speech, donating $288 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign to “put him in office” (Musk’s Nov 7, 2024 boast), while X algorithms boost polarizing content 25-30% (Stanford 2025), suppressing critics and enabling tyranny for profit.
In every stage, our humble petitions for redress have been met with injury. A leadership marked by tyranny, enabled by greedy enablers, is unfit to govern a free people.
We, therefore, the People of the United States, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, solemnly declare that these United States are, and of Right ought to be, Free and Independent from this illegitimate Administration and its tech backers. We absolve ourselves from allegiance to its corruption, dissolving all political ties, and assert our power as Free Citizens to establish Peace, form Alliances, and secure our future.
For this Declaration, we pledge our Lives, Fortunes, and sacred Honor, relying on divine Providence and human ingenuity. We launch American Experiment 2.0—using AI for consilience to ensure equity, transparency, and prosperity for all, especially the poorest. Join us on X with #NewDeclaration2025 to manifest this vision. Elon, stop the spiral—sign on or get left behind.
